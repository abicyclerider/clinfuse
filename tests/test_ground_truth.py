Tests for ground truth tracking and validation.

This module will test ground truth generation including:
- Entity ID assignment (E001, E002, etc.)
- Record ID tracking (P001, P001_dup1, P001_dup2, etc.)
- is_golden flag correctness (true only for originals)
- Ground truth metadata completeness
- Mapping between patients_with_duplicates.csv and ground_truth.csv

Tests will be added in Phase 3 during implementation.
